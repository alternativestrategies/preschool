              My name is Maria Cardarelli. Since August, 2018, I have been the Program Administrator of Children of the World learning Center <span id="dots">...</span></p>
  
            <span id="more">
              <p>I was born in Venezuela to an immigrant family from Italy. I was blessed enough to be raised in a diverse household where I was able to spend time in both countries. I have been in the US for 23 years where I adopted a third culture into my life and learned my third language.</p>
              <p>I am married, I have one daughter who is studying at UNC Chapel Hill. I have a Bachelor in Science and a Degree in Psychology with a specialization in Family and Childhood Therapy. I worked &nbsp;for 15 years in Venezuela under that profession and continued my professional career here in the US focused on family, community and social support and that relationship to education.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>For 18 years I was part of the creative and pioneering team of the first preschool with a dual language program that focused on educational support for Latino immigrants families.</p>
              <p>Today I was blessed again with the opportunity to guide the first Multicultural Preschool Program at Central United Methodist Church and be one of the leaders at Children of the World Learning Center.</p>
              <p>My work is based on my professional ethics, treating people with dignity and equity, meeting them at whatever point they are, focusing on the abilities, strengths and respecting the diversity as a positive gain and not as a negative exclusion.</p>
              <p >I read and use everyday a quote that Dr. Martin Luther King said;</p>

                My name is Jill Henley. I live in Mint Hill, and I am a member, here, at Central United Methodist Church. I am a Girl Scout leader and Sunday School teacher. I like to hike and camp, and I play the flute. My husband, Matt, is a machinist. My daughters Emma (10), and Molly (7) stay busy with school, church, and community activities. I have a dog named Brownie who likes to sit on my front porch and watch people all day

              <p>
                I have a BA in Elementary education from UNC Chapel Hill, and a MA in Literacy, from the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. Certification at Western Carolina University.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Most of my teaching experience has been as a Kindergarten teacher in North Carolina and Colorado public schools. For the last few years, I have been a stay-at-home mom, and I have been working on Birth through Kindergarten certification at Western Carolina University. I am looking forward to putting my experience as a Kindergarten teacher to work, as I help our preschool children prepare to enter school.
